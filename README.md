# Hi there, I'm Freddy Mangala 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an Engineer-Architect with a fairly good background in IT, more particularly in infrastructure (Cisco and Microsoft). I am passionate about the impact of development in the technical world, especially on CNC machines... I am now determined to take advantage of this interaction and want to push hard in development in general but more particularly in Python with its multiple ramifications in the technical world:

## 🚀 About Me

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced topics in the extraction of data into BIM-based applications, their processing and finally their repatriation on the one hand and the manufacturing process on the other hand via the programming of CNC machines.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to web development and Python.
- 📫 How to reach me: [mangalaf@hotmail.com](mailto: mangalaf@hotmail.com)
